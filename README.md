| **Data Collection**  | IoT Sensors + MySQL     | Continuous data from sensors stored in a central MySQL database.   |
| **ML Backend**       | Scikit-learn, XGBoost   | Forecasting, anomaly detection, optimization models, NLP based recommendation module           |
| **API Layer**        | FastAPI (RESTful)       | Connects backend, ML models, and frontend for seamless data flow.  |
| **Frontend**         | Next.js                 | Real-time visualizations and user interactions.                    |

## 🌐 Deployment Overview

- **Backend:** FastAPI, hosted on Render
- **Database:** MySQL on Railway
- **Frontend:** Next.js, deployed on Vercel

**Security:** Backend connects securely to the cloud database using environment variables. The frontend communicates with the backend via a public API.

## 🛠️ Local Development Guide

### 1. Set Up the MySQL Database

- Install MySQL.
- Create a new database (e.g., `SmartHomeEnergyUsageDB`).
- Import the provided `.sql` file to create tables and insert sample data.

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd fastapi-backend
# Create a .env file in the backend directory with your database credentials:
# DB_HOST=localhost
# DB_USER=root
# DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
# DB_NAME=SmartHomeEnergyUsageDB

pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
